# SystemDashboard

**SystemDashboard** is a prototype desktop application built with **Qt (C++)**, designed to display **real-time CPU usage** in a clean and minimal dashboard interface. This project is the first iteration of a system monitoring tool, with plans to expand to disk usage, temperature monitoring, and more.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Real-time CPU usage visualization
- üõ†Ô∏è Built with Qt (via Qt Creator) and C++
- üñ•Ô∏è Cross-platform UI using Qt Widgets (future support for Linux/macOS)

## Future Plans

The goal is to turn **SystemDashboard** into a fully-featured system monitor. Planned features include:

- üß† Memory (RAM) usage
- üíæ Disk usage
- üå°Ô∏è CPU and GPU temperatures
- üîå Network activity
- üß© Plugin support or modular display widgets

## Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a prototype and may require manual configuration and setup.

### Prerequisites

- Qt Creator (tested with Qt 6.x)
- Qt libraries for Widgets and Charts (if used)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC, GCC, or Clang)
